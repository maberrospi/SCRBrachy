# Segmentation for Catheter path Reconstruction in High-Dose Rate (HDR) prostate Brachytherapy.

This repo contains details on the development of two segmentation models aiming to segment catheters present in CT images. The segmentations can then be used to reconstruct the catheter paths. This is an important step to ensure success in prostate brachytherapy procedures.

The models (UNet & Attention Gated UNet) were trained using masks generated from CT data together with manual annotations of the catheter locations.

This work was part of an internship project and will not be subject to further improvements or maintenance.
